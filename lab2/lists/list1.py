#to make list we its name and then write members of list inside brackets []

#example:
mylist = ["banana","apple","pineaple"]
print(mylist)

#lists are allow us to keep dublicate members
mylist = ["banana","apple","pineaple","banana"]
print(mylist)


thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

#example of string, int and bool datatypes
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

#also lists can contain several datatypes
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]


mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))
