"""
To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

'''Open the file "demofile2.txt" and append content to the file:'''
f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")

'''Open the file "demofile3.txt" and overwrite the content:'''
f = open("demofile3.txt", "w")

"""To create a new file in Python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:

"x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exists

"a" - Append - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

"w" - Write - will create a file if the specified file does not exists

#Create a file called "myfile.txt":
